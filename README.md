# Implementation of Chatbot using NLP

A simple rule-based chatbot implemented in Python using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This project demonstrates how to build a basic conversational agent using pre-defined pattern matching and reflection.

## Overview

This project contains a Python script (`chatbot.py`) that utilizes NLTK's `Chat` utility to create a chatbot capable of handling basic greetings, questions, and responses using regular expressions. It is a lightweight example ideal for learning how to integrate NLP techniques in Python.

## Features

- **Simple Conversation Flow:** Responds to greetings and basic inquiries.
- **Pattern Matching:** Uses regular expressions to match user input with pre-defined responses.
- **Easy Customization:** Modify or extend the chatbot's behavior by updating the pattern-response pairs.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **NLTK**

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP.git
   cd Implementation-of-Chatbot-using-NLP
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install NLTK using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

3. **Download NLTK Data (if needed):**

   In a Python shell, run:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

## Usage

Run the chatbot by executing:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

The chatbot will start, and you can type your messages to interact with it. Type `quit` to exit the conversation.

## Customization

The core logic of the chatbot is defined in the `pairs` list inside `chatbot.py`. Each entry in this list is a pair where:
- The first element is a regular expression that matches user input.
- The second element is a list of possible responses.

Feel free to add new patterns or modify responses to better suit your needs.
